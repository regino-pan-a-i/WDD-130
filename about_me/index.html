                Hello here! My name is Andre Regino, I was born in Mexico City and lived there until last year when I moved up here.
                When I was 7 years old I loved seeing my dad play the piano the few times that he did, that inspired me to learn how to play it myself.
                At the moment I have taught my self how to play piano, guitar, and flute, 
            </p>
            <p> 
                My major is Software Engineering. I am the first one in my family to study college abroad. 
                Ever since we were kids my dad would tell us of his dream of going to BYU, and even though he tried after having a family things never lined up for it.
                Both, me and my older sisters are students at BYU-I but since she got married in Mexico during the pandemic their plans of comming up here also changed.
                I am really exited to get the full potential of what this experience has to offer.
